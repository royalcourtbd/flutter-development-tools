## 🔄 Updates

To update the tools:

1. **Edit the master files:**
   - `~/scripts/flutter-tools/fdev.py`
   - `~/scripts/flutter-tools/create_page.py`
   - `~/scripts/flutter-tools/gemini_api.py`

2. **Changes are automatically available globally!**

### AI Configuration
The Gemini AI features use Google's Gemini API. The API key is configured in `gemini_api.py`.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Command not found
- **Windows**: Make sure `%USERPROFILE%\bin` is in your PATH
- **macOS/Linux**: Make sure `$HOME/bin` is in your PATH
- Restart your terminal after PATH changes

### Permission denied (macOS/Linux)
```bash
chmod +x ~/scripts/flutter-tools/*.py
chmod +x ~/bin/fdev ~/bin/create-page
```

### Python not found
Make sure Python 3 is installed and available in your PATH.

### Flutter project not detected
Make sure you're running commands from the root of a Flutter project (where `pubspec.yaml` exists).

### AI commit message generation fails
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the Gemini API key in `gemini_api.py`
- Make sure you have git changes to analyze
- Try running `python3 gemini_api.py` to test the API connection
